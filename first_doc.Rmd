```

This project documents my ability to use Git and GitHub to version control an R Studio Project. I'll be modifying this report, staging and comitting changes and then pushing to GitHub

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph).

```{r test-plot}
plot(cars, col ="red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```

a summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
